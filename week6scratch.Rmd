## Comprehensible Input (Krashen)

## Input processing (VanPatten)



## Another take...

Language learners have a lot of tasks 

1. Learning new words
 - Learning new sounds....the use of phonetic cues and their role in word level distinctions (phonology)
 - Learning new orthographic-sound mappings 
 
2. Learning new grammatical rules 
 - Parse word order differently 
 - Parse (verbal) inflection differently 
 - Process agreement and mood not present in the L1

3. Pragmatics 
 - Ese hombre vs El hombre ese 
 
Learners have limited cognitive resources 

Hypothesis: It is impossible to ask learners to attend to all of these things simultaneously early in the process of acquisition - learners will focus on one part but not the other.

Absolute beginners: Grammar translation 
Beginners: Audiolingual drills (Bidenko, L., & Bespalova, H. (2017))
Intermediate-Advanced: Advanced audioloingual drills and communicative and meaning driven activities for incidental learning with a focus on pragmatics (explained in the target language)
